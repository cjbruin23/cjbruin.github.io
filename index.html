    <h1>Colin's Portfolio</h1>

        <h2>Starter</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and spent the first 12 years of my life in the Indy area. After that,
            I moved to Zionsville, Indiana where I completed middle school and all of high school. Most of my childhood was centered
            around finding the most risky activities I could and dreamed of being a professional skateboarder and BMX biker. I had a solid 1.7 GPA by the end of 
            my sophmore year. On a trip to California, a guy pulled up in a Lamborghini next to where I was standing so I asked him what he did. 
            He said he started as an engineer and now ran his own company. When I asked him how to become an engineer he said study hard, so I put away the 
            skateboard and bike and started picking up more books, finishing high school on a strong note.</p>

        <h2>College and Such</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For college I decided to attend Indiana University and study economics and history. I enjoyed the first
            year and a half of my classes but then ran into problems. The economics classes were too theoretical and 
            didn't have much practical knowledge. I decided to take a class in Econometrics, where statistical analysis is applied to quesitons in economics. 
            We primarily used the program <i>R</i>, where our teacher stressed we learn how to program. I did not like the programing
            aspect as much but enjoyed statistics. </p>
    </div>

        <h2>Tectonic Shift</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to take a programming class in Python since Python was being rapidly developed to help users
            in statistical analysis and the like. I found enjoyment in the programming and logical reasoning that it took. 
            I could spend hours trying to solve assigned and random problems that came up. I then shifted my focus from 
            statistical analytics to programming and went to <strong>IUPUI</strong> where I got a certificate in web development. I worked a little
            bit on small web development projects until I found Kenzie and now, here I am.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Vacation Spots</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Puerto Vallarto, Mexico</summary>
        <p>This actually isn't really first on my list but I'll never forget my Spring Break here. Or at least won't forget the parts I remember. I'll leave out 
            most of the finer <i>details</i> (get it?) and just say it was a fun time in great weather. Even though the bartenders there were 100% pouring drinks without alcohol
            to save money but we figured that out early and got around it.</p>

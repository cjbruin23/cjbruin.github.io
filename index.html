    <h1>Colin's Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>Starter</h2>
    <p>I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and spent the first 12 years of my life in the Indy area. After that,
        I moved to Zionsville, Indiana where I completed middle school and all of high school. Most of my childhood was centered
        around finding the most risky activities I could and dreamed of being a professional skateboarder and BMX biker. I had a solid 1.7 GPA by the end of 
        my sophmore year. On a trip to California, a guy pulled up in a Lamborghini next to where I was standing so I asked him what he did. 
        He said he started as an engineer and now ran his own company. When I asked him how to become an engineer he said study hard, so I put away the 
        skateboard and bike and started picking up more books, finishing high school on a strong note.</p>
    
    <h2>College and Such</h2>
        <p>For college I decided to attend Indiana University and study economics and history. I enjoyed the first
            year and a half of my classes but then ran into problems. The economics classes were too theoretical and 
            didn't have much practical knowledge. I decided to take a class in Econometrics, where statistical analysis is applied to quesitons in economics. 
            We primarily used the program R, where our teacher stressed we learn how to program. I did not like the programing
            aspect as much but enjoyed statistics. </p>

    <h2>Tectonic Shift</h2>
    <p>I deceided to take a programming class in Python since Python was being rapidly developed to help users
        in statistical analysis and the like. I found enjoyment in the programming and logical reasoning that it took. 
        I could spend hours trying to solve assigned and random problems that came up. I then shifted my focus from 
        statistical analytics to programming and went to IUPUI where I got a certificate in web development. I worked a little
    bit on small web development projects until I found Kenzie and now, here I am.</p>
